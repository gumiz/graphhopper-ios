This is a pseudo fork of https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper but for tag 0.8.2 
 
Same could be achived by: 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper-ios 
cd graphhopper-ios/ 
git checkout 0.8.2 
git submodule update -â€“init 
./graphhopper-ios-sample/import-sample.sh 
git submodule update 
```

graphhopper-ios
===============

graphhopper-ios wraps [graphhopper](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/) 
and creates the `libgraphhopper.a` library to be used on iOS and OS X. 
It uses [j2objc](https://github.com/google/j2objc) to translate the .java sources 
into Objective-C.

> **Disclaimer:** This is experimental so treat it accordingly. [Feel free to help](CONTRIBUTING.md) in any way.

## Getting Started

To get started run the following commands in Terminal:

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper-ios.git
cd graphhopper-ios
```

This will clone the repository and all its submodules. Now you are ready 
to use GraphHopper on iOS or OS X.

You have two options:

1. Head over to [graphhopper-ios-sample](graphhopper-ios-sample) 
and follow the instructions there. This is the easiest way to get started.

2. Manually add *graphhopper.xcodeproj* to your Xcode project. See the Usage section below.
 
## Community

Feel free to raise problems or questions in [our forum](https://discuss.graphhopper.com/c/graphhopper/graphhopper-ios-and-android).

## Usage

You can either add *graphhopper.xcodeproj* to your project and let Xcode compile the library 
or you can compile it from the Terminal and then add the library and sources
to your Xcode project.

### Xcode

To configure your project to use *graphhopper.xcodeproj* follow the steps below:

- Drag&drop *graphhopper.xcodeproj* into your project (or use the menu File -> Add Files to...)
- Expand graphhopper.xcodeproj and drag&drop the **Translations** and **Libraries** 
groups into your project (make sure you check "Create folder references" and have 
your target selected in "Add to targets:")
- In the Build Settings of your project:
    - add `-ObjC` to your target's Other Linker Flags
    - add `{path-to-graphhopper-ios}/j2objc/include` and `{path-to-graphhopper-ios}/src` 
    to your target's User Header Search Paths
- In the Build Phases of your project:
    - in Target Dependencies add the **graphhopper** target
    - in Link Binary With Libraries add **Security.framework** (to support secure hash generation), 
**libz.dylib** (needed to support java.util.zip) and **libicucore.dylib** (to support java.text, 
which is a dependency introduced by [j2objc 0.9.5](https://github.com/google/j2objc/releases/tag/0.9.5))

You're now ready to use GraphHopper on iOS and OS X.

> You are responsible for importing graph data. For an example check out 
[graphhopper-ios-sample](graphhopper-ios-sample).

### Terminal

Alternatively, you can translate and compile the library by invoking `make` 
in the Terminal. You can then link the library 
`graphhopper-ios/build/libgraphhopper.a` and it's header files at `graphhopper-ios/src` 
manually into your project. For all the other configurations see the Xcode section above.

> This method compiles the library for the following architectures: 
macosx, simulator, iphoneos, so using Xcode instead is recommended.

## Example

![iPhone-offline-routing](screenshots/iPhone-offline-routing.gif)

## Requirements

* iOS 7.0+ or OS X 10.10 (it might work on older versions but haven't tested)
* JDK 1.7 or higher
* Xcode 6.0 or higher

## Troubleshooting

If you run into problems, you can try one of the following:

* if using Xcode, try cleaning up the project (Product -> Clean)
* if using the Terminal, you can use one of these 2 cleanup commands:
  * `make clean` - will delete the /graphhopper-ios/build directory
  * `make cleanall` - if the first one didn't do it, this will delete everything 
related to the build process (you then need to run `make class.list`)
