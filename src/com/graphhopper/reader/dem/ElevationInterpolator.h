/**
 @brief Elevation interpolator calculates elevation for the given lat/lon coordinates based on lat/lon/ele coordinates of the given points.
 <p> In case of two points, elevation is calculated using linear interpolation (see #calculateElevationBasedOnTwoPoints(double,double,double,double,double,double,double,double) ). <p> In case of three points, elevation is calculated using planar interpolation (see #calculateElevationBasedOnThreePoints(double,double,double,double,double,double,double,double,double,double,double) ). <p> In case of more than three points, elevation is calculated using the interpolation method described in the <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/a/1930758/140512">following post</a> (see #calculateElevationBasedOnPointList(double,double,PointList) .
