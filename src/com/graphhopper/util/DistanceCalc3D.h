/**
 @brief This class implements a rather quick solution to calculate 3D distances on earth using euclidean geometry mixed with Haversine formula used for the on earth distance.
 The haversine formula makes not so much sense as it is only important for large distances where then the rather smallish heights would becomes neglectable. <p>
